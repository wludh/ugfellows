Stage 1: Planning
  Welcome to "Exploring the CPDS"! Beginning over 55 years ago, data began to be recorded for many different facets of political life. A team of researchers at the University of Berne, led by Klaus Armingeon, compiled the data together from 24 different studies covering 36 different countries. As a result, one can find nearly any political statistic they wish within this group of Excel documents; the only problem being how difficult it is to read and interpret for the layperson. This project aims to simplify and visualize the complex findings of Armingeon et. all's study. Specifically, this project will compare many of the countries included in the CPDS in order to see differences in development, gender relations, voter turnout, and other variables while paying utmost attention to the historical political context of the countries to account for the disparities. Comparative political data has never before been so broadly published, so it would of course make sense that "Exploring the CPDS" will maintain that broad, holistic perspective.

Stage 2: Data - Cleanup
  At first glance, cpds_main.xlsx (CPDS I) is the most well-organized file for data processing. The formatting is basic, with simple headers, and no merged and centered cells. Accordingly, it was easy to select each country's data, and move them each to a new sheet, where the three digit name is the international code for that country. Then, each of these sheets can be moved to a new workbook, named cpds_main_yyy.csv, where <yyy> is the country code.
