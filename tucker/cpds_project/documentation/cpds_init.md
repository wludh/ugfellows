# Project planning

â€‹## Project description

* Brief Description:
Using data recently updated in the "Comparative Political Data Set" (CPDS) by 
Armingeon et. all, I plan to make a dynamic and interactive visualization of this massive political data set. I hope that the user will be able to completely customize what variables/countries/years/etc. they want to analyze at a given time, and do so. If they wish to compare the voter turnouts of the Czech Republic before the end of the USSR and the voter turnout of Sweden at the same time--they can do that.   

* Elevator Pitch:
I am creating a dynamic and vivid picture of macro-comparative politics, as well as creating a tool that can be used to study politics at a country-by-country basis. After integrating CPDS, I will update and expand to other data sources to allow for even more customization--perhaps even extending back in time as well as adding more expansive data to the collection.

* Thesis:
I believe my project will be a wonderful illustration of the development of many different nations at once, as well as showing an observer the world history of the past ~60 years at a glance. 

## Project goals

* To accomplish:
1) I want to create a fully interactive visualization of the CPDS, as well as allowing myself space to expand the data. 
2) I want the user to be able to select multiple variables and visualization styles in order to have complete control over the results of the data
3) I want to use Python to calculate certain significant results (GDP ratios, etc etc.)
4) I would prefer the data to be contained in its own client, but a service like Tableau with file sharing/publishing would be just as good

* Final Project:
-The final project will be in an app--either its own app or a service like Tableau--and will be completely customizable to the user's intentions. Any variable can be paired with any variable, etc. 
-I will need to use Excel, Tableau, Python (Powershell, Atom), and possibly other software to get to my end. I would like to host a version of the project on my website. 

## Progress

* So far:
1) Found data/key
2) Explored data = clean

* To do:
1) Decide on visualization software
	-Palladio, Tableau, Excel, etc
	-Research similar projects for ideas
2) Data is clean. 
3) Insert data into visualizer
4) Adjust project until it works
	-Cannot forsee problems uploading data, but there always are some
5) Export visualization
	-website, visualizer self-sharing, screenshots, etc
6) Writeup, etc. 

* Can you order/rank your next steps? 
1) Above.
