​Project description

I will be farming and analyzing the thousands of emails released last year by Wikileaks concerning the Clinton campaign. Like "Quanitifying Kissinger" I hope to create a data cloud that can show the trends in what topics are discussed in the emails as a whole, and also show that trend over time.  

"I am creating a cloud of the topics discussed in every one of Podesta's emails, and analyzing them to reveal the trends over time. 
 Not so much a thesis. I believe that the results will be very telling, but I am honestly unsure of whether or not the Clinton campaign was as corrupt as it was portrayed.

## Project goals
11
* I want to be able to definitively say "Hillary Clinton is corrupt" (hopefully the opposite) at the end of this project.  
12
* The final project will be a cloud of the thousands, if not millions, of topics discussed in the emails. I will try to cut out anything unnecessary, but the large scale of the data is something I want to keep intact. The user will be able to slide through different time frames, and see highlighted what the topics most discussed were. Additionally, I would like to include a link to news stories about the topic.

## Disclaimer
21
* Your "project" doesn't have to be a full-fledged, start to finish project. It could complement work you're doing for a thesis or capstone. You could work to develop your own domain as a customized portfolio. You could continue developing a project idea from another class. You could evaluate the methodology options in a certain area like text analysis or digital exhibits. You could write a detailed tutorial for a DH tool, a la [Programming Historian](programminghistorian.org).
22
* However, you should think about what your final "product" could be. Is it a website? A tutorial? Analysis that serves a traditional paper?
