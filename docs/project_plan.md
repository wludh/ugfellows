# Project planning

Copy this template to your own folder and GitHub. Fill it out with information about your own project. 

## Project description
* Give a brief description of your project. 
* What would your "elevator pitch" be? 
* Do you have a thesis? 

## Project goals
* What do want to accomplish with this project? 
* What does the final product look like? 
* What skills do you want to develop? What technology/methodology do you want to use?

## Progress
* What have you done so far? 
* What do you need to do? 
* Can you order/rank your next steps? 

## Disclaimer
* Your "project" doesn't have to be a full-fledged, start to finish project. It could complement work you're doing for a thesis or capstone. You could work to develop your own domain as a customized portfolio. You could continue developing a project idea from another class. You could evaluate the methodology options in a certain area like text analysis or digital exhibits. You could write a detailed tutorial for a DH tool, a la Programming Historian.
* However, you should think about what your final "product" could be. Is it a website? A tutorial? Analysis that serves a traditional paper?
